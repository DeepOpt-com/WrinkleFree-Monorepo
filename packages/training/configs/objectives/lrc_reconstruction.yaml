# Low-Rank Correction Reconstruction Objective
# Trains LRC adapters (U, V matrices) to minimize reconstruction error
# between quantized+LRC student and fp16 teacher hidden states.
#
# Based on: "Low-Rank Correction for Quantized LLMs" (arxiv 2412.07902)
enabled: false  # Off by default
weight: 1.0

# Loss type: mse, mse_normalized, cosine
loss_type: mse

# Per-layer weights: null (uniform), "progressive", "exponential", or custom list
# Progressive recommended: later layers often have more quantization error
layer_weights: progressive

# Temperature scaling for loss (divides total loss by temperature)
temperature: 1.0

# L2 normalize hidden states before computing loss
normalize: false
