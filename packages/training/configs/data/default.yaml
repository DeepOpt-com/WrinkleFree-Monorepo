# Minimal data config - delegates to CheaperTraining
#
# 1.58Quant doesn't manage data configs. The actual data config
# (sources, probes, weights) lives in CheaperTraining/configs/data/
#
# Available configs in CheaperTraining:
#   - mixed_pretrain: Multi-source with influence-based remixing (recommended)
#   - fineweb: Single-source FineWeb-Edu (no influence)
#   - downstream: SFT/finetuning tasks (Stage 3)
