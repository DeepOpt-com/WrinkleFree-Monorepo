# Dynamic sparse attention based on attention entropy
# Adapts sparsity per query based on how focused attention is
# Inspired by DejaVu contextual sparsity

attention_sparsity:
  enabled: true
  mode: "dynamic"
  dynamic:
    min_ratio: 0.1   # Minimum tokens to attend to (focused attention)
    max_ratio: 0.5   # Maximum tokens to attend to (diffuse attention)
  track_stats: true

# Entropy-based: Low entropy (focused) → more sparsity is safe
# Expected sparsity: 50-90% depending on attention pattern
